      <description>&lt;p&gt;As this is the first post of my personal blog, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be different: today I will write a bit about my academic and professional journey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my studies back in 2009, when I started a technical course in mechanics at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ifes.edu.br/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Federal Institute of Espírito Santo&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil. In this course, I was exposed to a range of topics including mechanical projects, electronics, mechanical fabrication, metrology, materials science and beyond. The course was half-half theory and practice. Thereby, I also acquired some hands-on experience. Further, I had the opportunity to lead the welding lab practices for a cohort of about 20 students during one semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, I was fortunate to be admitted to the main university of my state, &lt;a href=&#34;https://internacional.ufes.br/en/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UFES&lt;/a&gt;, in the undergraduate course of Mechanical Engineering. Simultaneously, I started to learn the English and German languages, as I was planning to one day study abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the Brazilian government launched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/acoes-e-programas/programas/ciencia-sem-fronteiras&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Science Without Boarders - CSF&lt;/a&gt; exchange program, which gave the opportunity to outstanding students to have experiences abroad by providing them with scholarships. As I was already learning foreign languages and had good grades in my undergraduate studies, I could meet the admission requirements and I was offered a scholarship to study in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, I moved to Dresden, Germany, to then start my exchange program. There, I lived for 3 months and participated in intensive German culture and language courses. After this adaptation period, I moved to the city of Zwickau, where I participated in the Automotive Engineering and Management course as an exchange master student. During the course, I had the opportunity to gain general knowledge about the automotive industry, such as motor development, acoustics, logistics and beyond. Importantly, I also had my first experiences with simulation sciences (in particular computational fluid dynamics), which rapidly increased my interest in the field. Besides that, I did an internship at Audi AG on the resistance welding development team between 2014 and 2015. There, I learned more about the German labor market, vividly experienced the German culture, and gained knowledge of robotic welding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the internship at Audi AG, I moved back to Brazil to finish my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering. Simultaneously, I did an internship in a local company (Tecvix), where I was responsible for performing mechanical and fluid dynamics simulations for diverse projects in the oil and gas industry. These simulation experiences, together with the similar experiences I had in Germany, directly influenced my decision to further expand my knowledge in the direction of computational sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After concluding the undergraduate course in Mechanical Engineering in the middle of 2017, I was fortunate to be admitted to the master in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/cse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Computational Sciences in Engineering&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Technical University of Braunschweig&lt;/a&gt;. During my masters&amp;rsquo; studies, I chose the specialization in Mathematics and Computer Science, but I also took diverse lectures in fluid dynamics. Simultaneously with the theoretical lectures, I sought to improve my research abilities. Therefore, I worked as a research assistant in two different research institutes for more than 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifn/institute/dept/sv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute for Communications Technology&lt;/a&gt;, I worked on projects related to the robustness of semantic segmentation deep neural networks (DNNs) under the supervision of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifn/institute/team/sv/baer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andreas Bär&lt;/a&gt;. Among others, the tasks I contributed include: improving an existing approach for domain mismatch estimation by means of multi-task learning and autoencoders; implementing a teacher-student framework for semantic segmentation; and implementing a PyTorch-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ifnspaml/TUBSRobustCheck&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;toolbox&lt;/a&gt; to assess the robustness of semantic segmentation DNNs against diverse adversarial attacks and corruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I also worked as a research assistant at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/fmb/institute-fk4/institutes/institute-of-joining-and-welding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute of Joining and Welding&lt;/a&gt;. There, I had further hands-on experience in simulation sciences and machine learning by working on diverse weld-related projects. My activities there included: development of a differential geometry-based tool to assess porosity properties in welded specimens using 3D computed tomography data; implementation of a ResNet-based data-efficient neural network for the prediction of stress-strain curve of welded alloys using multi-fidelity (2D/3D simulation and experimental) depth-indentation testing data; execution of multi-focal laser welding thermal simulations for welding parameter estimation; and developed a weld bead image segmentation tool to automatically segment and measure weld beads.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I wrote my masters thesis at the Technical University of Munich where I was supervised by &lt;a href=&#34;https://vision.in.tum.de/members/golkov&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vladimir Golkov&lt;/a&gt; and worked on topics around understanding of deep learning, self-supervised learning, and unsupervised deep domain adaptation. If you are interested in reading more about my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, please take a look at [this post].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I would like to share my research interests: I am interested in developing autonomous (also aerial) vehicles. In particular, I would like to research about data-efficient methods to improve robotic perception and planning by exploiting strategies such as self-supervised/unsupervised learning, transfer learning, etc. Further, I am also excited about endowing deep learning algorithms with strong learning biases/regularizers to give them the ability to better understand the complex world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
